# PacMan
# Description: 
This program prompts the user with two options: add PacMan or start movement. Once the PacMen are added, they can be set in motion, they will move until the collide with the edge of the window and bounce off.

# Roadmap of future improvements: 
In the future, I would like to have differant color PacMen be created at random. After that, I would like for PacMen to bounce off of each-other when they collode with each-other.
